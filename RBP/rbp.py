Relevance-Based Prediction (RBP) and Relevance-Based Importance (RBI) Implementation

This module implements the RBP prediction methodology and RBI variable importance framework
as described in the research paper. The core idea is to weight past observations by their
relevance to the current prediction task, where relevance combines similarity and informativeness.

Key Components:
- MarketDataFetcher: Retrieves historical market data from Financial Modeling Prep API
- FeatureEngineer: Transforms raw market data into predictive features
- MahalanobisDistanceCalculator: Computes statistical distances between observations
- RelevanceCalculator: Determines how relevant past observations are to current predictions
- PredictionWeightCalculator: Converts relevance scores into observation weights
- RBPPredictor: Main prediction engine that generates forecasts
- RBICalculator: Computes variable importance scores for interpretability
